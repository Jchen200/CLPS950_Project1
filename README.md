# CLPS 0950 Group Project 1

Tutorial:
- Input an image of cells by copying the path name of the image from your computer into the first line of the code.
- This code assumes that you know that what the volume of the cells is (this code assumes that each image is 20 uL, but you can change the volume in the line of code with the variable name 'volume')

When you hit "Run," the output will be a figure of the cell image and the total cell count & concentration in cells/mL.
